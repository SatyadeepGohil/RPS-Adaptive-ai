# üéÆ RPS Self-Adapting AI

A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** built with **TypeScript, Node (Express), Postgres, HTML, and CSS**, featuring multiple difficulty modes and an AI-based opponent that adapts to the player‚Äôs behavior.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

* *The system is under R\&D for a Self-Adapting system.*
* *Database is present but currently unused; future updates will include database-driven features.*
* *The server exists but is not actively used.*

## üöÄ Features

* **Difficulty Modes**:

  * `Easy`: Opponent plays random moves.
  * `Medium`: Opponent adapts to the player‚Äôs most common moves.
  * `Hard` & `Extreme`: Reserved for future predictive/adaptive strategies.
* **Round Types**: Play infinite rounds or limited rounds (5, 10, or 15).
* **Scoring System**: Tracks user, opponent, and tie counts.
* **Custom State Management**:

  * **Purpose:** Manage game state and allow components to react to changes.
  * **Key Methods:**

    * `setState(prop, value)`: Update a single property; observers are triggered if value changes.
    * `setStates(partial)`: Update multiple properties at once; only triggers relevant observers.
    * `observe(observer)`: Register callbacks that react to the properties they read.
  * **Behavior:** Uses a `Proxy` to track dependencies automatically, enabling fine-grained reactivity without unnecessary updates.
* **UI/UX**:

  * Flip animation to reveal opponent‚Äôs move.
  * Scoreboard and round tracking.
  * Winner modal at the end of finite rounds.
* **AI Mechanics**:

  * Random move generation using `crypto.getRandomValues` (fallback to `Math.random`).
  * Adaptive mode counters based on player move history.
